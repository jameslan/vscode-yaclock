[Release Notes](https://github.com/jameslan/vscode-yaclock/releases)

## Features

- Works locally. Do not require to be installed into remote host when using VSCode Remote.
- Simple config. Do not need to learn how to format date time to string in javascript.
Checkbox rules all!
- Adaptive refresh rate. Refresh at the beginning of every second only when needed
(second is displayed or the separator is flashing),
otherwise refresh at the beginning of 0 second every minute.
- No window reload required for any config change.
- Standing out. With a configurable colorful emoji (prefix or postfix),
you could find the time with just a glimpse.
- Show full date time as tool tip of the clock status bar item.
Note that the tooltip appears only when the editor window is focused / activated.

## Tips

- To add [Standard Octicons](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/icons-in-labels) into
prefix or postfix, use `$()`, such as `$(clock)`
